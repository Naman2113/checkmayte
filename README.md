In the world of NFTs, there is a lot of value in owning EndGame Boards of actual matches. eg. What would be like to own an NFT of the game played between Kasparov and Deep Blue? Or of the famous Magnus Carlsen vs. The World chess game? Hence, we decided to introduce an additional improvement that the winner of the game gets an NFT of the game board, which gets created WHEN the game ends (and which contains the entire gameplay of the game)!

If these NFTs are then sold, we believe it opens up a new avenue for superfans to possess the actual gameboards for games played by their favorite players, and on the other hand, these NFTs can be also used by Top GrandMasters as part of the portfolio, sort of like a historic signifier of an tremendous accomplishment tied to the blockchain for all eternity!
